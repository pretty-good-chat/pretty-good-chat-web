This is the front-end of PGC. It uses Angular2 to provide awesome performances but mostly, we use Angular2 for the fun, because we love it !

##Stack
There are plenty of Angular2-seed out here, but [this one](https://github.com/ghpabs/angular2-seed) perfectly fits our needs (thanks [@ghpabs](https://github.com/ghpabs)).

**Included in the project :**
- [Gulp 4](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/)
- [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)

##How does it work ?
- :boy: PGC first ask user to choose a username
- :key: If it has not been already taken, PGC will create in your browser a public key and a private key
- :white_check_mark: It will share your public key with the server so you don't have to sign in again (remember to backup public/private key)
- :closed_lock_with_key: All your messages are encrypted before you send it to the server, so nobody is aware of what you are writing
